Reconnaissance Steps Performed:

1. Performed WHOIS lookup to identify domain registration details.
2. Enumerated subdomains using Sublist3r.
3. Identified web technologies using Wappalyzer browser extension.
4. Collected exposed service information using Shodan.
5. Performed asset mapping and relationship analysis using Maltego.

All steps were conducted using passive reconnaissance techniques
without interacting directly with the target infrastructure.
