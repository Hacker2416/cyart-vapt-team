Exploitation Performed:

1. SQL Injection exploitation was performed on DVWA using sqlmap.
2. Database enumeration was successful.
3. Tables and user credentials were extracted.
4. SQL Injection types confirmed:
   - Boolean-based blind
   - Error-based
   - Time-based blind
   - UNION-based

Impact:
Successful exploitation demonstrates the risk of improper input
validation and insecure application design.
