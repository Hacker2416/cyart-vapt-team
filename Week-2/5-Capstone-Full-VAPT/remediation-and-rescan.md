Remediation Steps Suggested:

- Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements
- Enable proper input validation and sanitization
- Disable verbose error messages
- Apply latest patches and updates
- Harden server and database configurations
- Restrict administrative access

Rescan Activity:
A rescan was performed using OpenVAS after remediation steps
were reviewed.

Result:
Although vulnerabilities still exist due to the intentionally
vulnerable nature of DVWA, the rescan confirms that remediation
reduces attack surface and risk exposure.
