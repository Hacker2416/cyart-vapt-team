This project demonstrates a complete Vulnerability Assessment and
Penetration Testing (VAPT) cycle conducted in a controlled lab
environment. The assessment identified critical security issues,
including SQL Injection and misconfigured services. These weaknesses
were successfully exploited to demonstrate their real-world impact.
Remediation steps were proposed to reduce security risks, followed
by a rescan to validate improvements. This exercise highlights the
importance of regular security testing, secure coding practices,
and continuous monitoring to protect applications and systems
from potential cyber threats.
