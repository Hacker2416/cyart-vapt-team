Subject: Critical Vulnerabilities Identified on Test Server – Immediate Attention Required

Dear Development Team,

During a routine vulnerability assessment conducted in a controlled lab environment, several critical security issues were identified on the target system (192.168.75.131). The scan revealed outdated Apache services, exposed phpMyAdmin interfaces, directory indexing, and multiple open ports. As a proof of concept, service enumeration using Nmap and vulnerability scanning with OpenVAS and Nikto confirmed exploitable configurations that could allow unauthorized access.

It is strongly recommended to patch outdated services, restrict administrative interfaces, disable directory listing, and close unnecessary ports. Please review the attached findings for remediation.

Regards,  
VAPT Analyst
