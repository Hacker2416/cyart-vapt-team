# Introduction

This task was performed to understand the fundamentals of Vulnerability
Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) using open-source tools.

The assessment was carried out in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux
as the attacker machine and an intentionally vulnerable system as the target.
This approach ensured safe and ethical testing without affecting real systems.
