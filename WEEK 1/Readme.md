# Week 1 – Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Overview
This repository documents the Week 1 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration
Testing (VAPT) activities performed in a controlled lab environment using
open-source security tools.

The assessment was conducted using Kali Linux as the attacker machine and
Metasploitable as the intentionally vulnerable target system.

## Objectives
- Understand the complete VAPT lifecycle
- Perform network discovery and vulnerability scanning
- Validate vulnerabilities through controlled exploitation
- Assess risks using CVSS scoring
- Align findings with security standards and compliance frameworks

## Lab Environment
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: Metasploitable
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Network Mode: Host-only / Internal Network

## Tools Used
- Nmap – Network discovery and service enumeration
- OpenVAS – Automated vulnerability scanning
- Nikto – Web server vulnerability scanning
- Metasploit Framework – Controlled exploitation
- OWASP ZAP – Web application vulnerability testing
- CherryTree – Documentation and risk tracking

## Key Findings
- Multiple critical and high-risk vulnerabilities identified
- Outdated services and default credentials detected
- Successful exploitation confirmed system compromise risk

## Security Standards Referenced
- OWASP Top 10
- ISO/IEC 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA
