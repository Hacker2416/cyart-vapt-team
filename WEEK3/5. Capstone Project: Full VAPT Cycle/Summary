A full VAPT capstone assessment was performed on a vulnerable lab system to evaluate security exposure. 
Scanning identified multiple weaknesses due to outdated services. Exploitation was successfully performed against the FTP service, resulting in root-level access to the target machine.
This confirms that an attacker could fully compromise the system, execute commands, and potentially steal or manipulate data. 
Immediate remediation is recommended, including patching or disabling vulnerable services, restricting open ports, and applying system hardening. 
After fixes, the system should be rescanned to verify that critical vulnerabilities are resolved. Regular security testing is advised to prevent recurrence.
