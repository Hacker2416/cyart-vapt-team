In this Week-3 VAPT practical, critical vulnerabilities were identified in a controlled lab environment.
A vulnerable FTP service allowed attackers to gain root-level access, leading to full system compromise. 
SQL Injection was confirmed in the DVWA web application, which could expose sensitive database information. 
Reflected XSS was also detected, allowing malicious scripts to execute in user browsers. 
These weaknesses increase the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, and service disruption. 
Recommended actions include patching outdated services, implementing secure coding practices, and improving session security. 
Re-testing should be performed after remediation to verify that vulnerabilities are resolved.
