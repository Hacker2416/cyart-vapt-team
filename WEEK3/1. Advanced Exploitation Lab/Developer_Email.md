Subject: Critical Issue - Chained Exploit Leading to RCE

Hello Team,
During Week-3 VAPT testing, 
I simulated a chained exploitation scenario where an initial web vulnerability can be used to gain unauthorized session access and then trigger remote code execution.
This can allow attackers to execute commands and compromise the server completely. Recommended fixes include strict input validation, output encoding, patching vulnerable services, and improving session security controls. 
Please prioritize this issue and confirm once remediation is applied so a retest can be performed.
Thanks,
Ujjwal Bhatt
