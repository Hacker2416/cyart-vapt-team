# Chained Exploit on Web Server

## Findings
CVE: CVE-2021-22205  
Host: 192.168.75.131  

## Description
A chained exploitation scenario was simulated where an initial vulnerability can be used to gain unauthorized access and then trigger remote code execution. 
This demonstrates how attackers can combine multiple weaknesses to fully compromise a system.

## Impact
Attackers can gain unauthorized access, execute commands remotely, and compromise system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Remediation
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Apply output encoding for web responses
- Patch vulnerable applications/services
- Use CSP and secure session controls
