I customized the Exploit-DB Python PoC by updating the target IP and endpoint path based on my lab setup. 
I adjusted the request parameters to match the vulnerable service behavior and added response validation to confirm exploitation success. 
I also improved stability by adding error handling and cleaner output logging.
