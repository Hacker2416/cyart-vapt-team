# Remediation Recommendations

## 1) FTP Service (vsftpd Backdoor Risk)
- Remove vulnerable or backdoored FTP services immediately.
- Upgrade vsftpd to a secure version from trusted repositories.
- Restrict FTP access using firewall rules (allow only trusted IPs).
- Disable anonymous login and enforce strong authentication.

## 2) Network Hardening
- Close unused ports and services.
- Apply least privilege and isolate services using VLANs/subnets.
- Monitor suspicious inbound connections and brute-force attempts.

## 3) Binary Exploitation Defenses
- Enable stack canaries (`-fstack-protector-strong`)
- Enable PIE (`-fPIE -pie`)
- Use full RELRO (`-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`)
- Avoid unsafe functions and validate input size
- Maintain ASLR enabled in production systems
