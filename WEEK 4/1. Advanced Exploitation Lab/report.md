# Task 01 Report: Advanced Exploitation Lab

## 1. Introduction
This task demonstrates an advanced exploitation workflow including reconnaissance, exploitation using Metasploit, PoC modification, and local binary analysis. The goal was to validate exploitation concepts in an authorized lab environment and document findings, evidence, and remediation steps.

## 2. Scope
- Target IP: 192.168.75.131
- Environment: Local lab VM (Metasploitable2)
- Tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Python, Ghidra, checksec

## 3. Reconnaissance & Enumeration
An Nmap scan was performed to identify open ports and running services. The target exposed multiple services including FTP, SSH, HTTP, SMB, and database ports.

## 4. Exploitation (Metasploit)
The service `vsftpd 2.3.4` was identified and exploited using Metasploit module:
`exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`

A command shell was obtained and privilege level was validated using standard commands.

## 5. Post Exploitation Validation
The following commands confirmed access and system information:
- whoami
- id
- hostname
- uname -a
- ip a

This confirms successful remote command execution and root access in the lab environment.

## 6. Custom PoC (Exploit-DB)
A public exploit PoC from Exploit-DB was copied using searchsploit and executed after adapting to the target setup. Output generation confirmed the PoC worked in the controlled environment.


## 7. Local Binary Analysis & Reverse Engineering
A local vulnerable binary was compiled for learning purposes with stack protections disabled. The binary was then imported into Ghidra for analysis. The decompiled output highlighted unsafe input handling patterns.


## 8. Defense Verification (ASLR + checksec)
Binary protections were verified using checksec and system ASLR status was checked.


## 9. Findings Summary
- Vulnerable FTP service allowed command execution.
- Weak or missing binary protections increase exploitability.
- ASLR status impacts exploitation reliability.

## 10. Remediation
See `remediation.md` for full recommendations.

## 11. Conclusion
This task successfully demonstrated a complete exploitation workflow: enumeration, exploitation, PoC handling, reverse engineering, and defense verification. All steps were performed in a legal lab environment with documentation suitable for academic review and GitHub submission.
