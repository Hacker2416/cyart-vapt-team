# Task 01: Advanced Exploitation Lab

## Objective
Perform an advanced exploitation workflow using:
- Metasploit exploitation
- Custom PoC execution/modification (Exploit-DB)
- Local binary analysis (Ghidra)
- Defense/bypass validation (ASLR + checksec)

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Metasploit Framework
- Nmap
- Python
- Ghidra
- checksec

## Target Details
- Target IP: `192.168.75.131`
- Lab VM: Metasploitable2 (internal lab environment)

## Activities Completed
 Recon / Enumeration (Nmap)  
 Exploitation (Metasploit vsftpd backdoor)  
 Post Exploitation Commands (whoami, id, uname -a, ip a)  
 Custom PoC (Exploit-DB Python PoC executed/modified)  
 Local Binary Setup + Analysis (compiled vuln + Ghidra)  
 Defense Verification (checksec + ASLR status)
